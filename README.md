# Sudoku Solver, submission from TISVV


<p>
  This sudoku solver can accept sudokus in 2 ways, either from a .csv (comma separated values) file or get it directly from the user via the terminal. <br>
  
</p>

## How to use the csv:

<p>
  A file named "Sudoku.csv" should already exist in the folder with "Sudoku_Solver.py", and it should have 9 rows & columns, with the sudoku puzzle, where "0" represents empty space.
  <br>
  If user chooses to use the csv file as input, a new file called "Sudoku_Solution.csv" will be created and will be the completely solved sudoku, if any solution is possible for the given puzzle.
</p>

## Modules used

<p> Only the csv module is being used for file handling, the main algorithm for solving sudoku is in pure python </p>
